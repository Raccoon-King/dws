## DWS Microservice Implementation Action Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core DWS Service

**Objective:** Establish the basic DWS microservice structure and implement its core functionality.

*   **Task 1.1: Project Setup & Repository Initialization** [x]
    *   Create new Go project for DWS microservice.
    *   Initialize Git repository and establish basic project structure.
*   **Task 1.2: Document Ingestion Mechanism** [x]
    *   Implement S3 event listener (or equivalent mechanism) to trigger DWS processing upon document upload.
    *   Develop logic to retrieve documents (PDF, TXT, JSON, YAML, XML, HTML) from S3.
*   **Task 1.3: YAML Rulebook Management** [x]
    *   Design and implement a mechanism for loading and parsing `rules.yaml` files.
    *   Develop logic to dynamically switch between different rule sets.
*   **Task 1.4: Core Dirty Word Matching Logic** [x]
    *   Implement the algorithm for efficient and accurate matching of words/phrases against the loaded rule sets.
    *   Consider performance optimizations for large documents and extensive rule sets.
*   **Task 1.5: DWS Microservice API Development** [x]
    *   Design and implement RESTful API endpoints for the DWS microservice (e.g., to trigger scans manually, retrieve scan results).

### Phase 2: Integration & Reporting

**Objective:** Connect the DWS microservice with existing systems and generate actionable reports.

*   **Task 2.1: Document Parsing & Text Extraction**
    *   Implement robust parsers for each document type (PDF, TXT, JSON, YAML, XML, HTML) to extract plain text content for scanning.
*   **Task 2.2: JSON Report Generation**
    *   Develop the structure and logic for generating comprehensive JSON reports, including flagged words/phrases, context, and severity (if applicable).
*   **Task 2.3: Report Storage Integration**
    *   Integrate with MySQL to store DWS reports, linking them to the original documents.
    *   Consider indexing strategies for efficient report retrieval.
*   **Task 2.4: Frontend Integration**
    *   Collaborate with frontend team to consume DWS API for scan results.
    *   Implement UI/UX for displaying DWS reports and highlighting issues within documents.

### Phase 3: Deployment & Operations

**Objective:** Ensure the DWS microservice is deployable, scalable, and observable in production.

*   **Task 3.1: Kubernetes Deployment Configuration**
    *   Create Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress, etc.) for the DWS microservice.
    *   Define resource limits, scaling policies, and environment variables.
*   **Task 3.2: CI/CD Pipeline Development**
    *   Set up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines for the DWS microservice.
*   **Task 3.3: Monitoring & Logging**
    *   Integrate DWS microservice with existing monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging (e.g., ELK stack) solutions.
*   **Task 3.4: Security Hardening**
    *   Implement security best practices for the Go application, Docker image, and Kubernetes deployment (e.g., least privilege, network policies, secret management).

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement

**Objective:** Validate the functionality, performance, and security of the DWS microservice.

*   **Task 4.1: Unit & Integration Testing**
    *   Develop comprehensive unit tests for all DWS components.
    *   Implement integration tests for interactions with S3, MySQL, and the DWS API.
*   **Task 4.2: End-to-End Testing**
    *   Conduct end-to-end tests simulating the full workflow from document upload to frontend display of results.
*   **Task 4.3: Performance Testing**
    *   Perform load and stress testing to ensure the DWS microservice can handle expected document volumes and sizes.
*   **Task 4.4: Security Testing**
    *   Conduct vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify and mitigate security risks.
*   **Task 4.5: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
    *   Engage end-users to validate the DWS functionality and user experience.
